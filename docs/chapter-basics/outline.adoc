# Introduction
 - How I will treat the content
 - What will I use, why am I using them (tools, approach, how different from OCJP)
 - What I will cover, what I will not cover
 
# Overview

- What you need, software, hardware, wetware
- What will we use (no IDE, why) 
- Some word about the IDEs

- cover some setup here
- You will be working on the command line

Assumptions that I made

- You know your operating system, this book is not an OS introduction
- You know the basic operations on your OS such as creating a file, fixing permissions etc
